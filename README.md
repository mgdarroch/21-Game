# 21-Game
A Threaded Multiplayer 21 Game

This project was created for an assessment at the University of Glasgow.  It is a multiplayer 21 game which utilises threading.  In it's default setting, the program requires four players to run though this can be changed at any time by altering the default settings in the Server class.  First run Server.java, then run four of Client.java.
